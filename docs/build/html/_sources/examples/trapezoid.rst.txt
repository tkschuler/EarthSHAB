Downloading GFS Forecasts
==========================

GFS Forecasts are downloaded from the `NOAA's NOMADS server <https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/dods/gfs_0p25/>`_ at a 0.25 degree resolution.  

``saveNETCDF.py`` downloads the data from the server and saves them to a *.nc* file to use in EarthSHAB.  By saving the file for offline use,  running batch simulations is exponentially faster than having to re-download the same forecast from the server for every simulation run.  

The following parameters need to be adjusted in the configuration file before saving a netcdf forecast. 

- ``gfs``: the start time of the gfs forecast downloaded from the server (These are in the form of *gfs20231008/gfs_0p25_00z*).  Start times ares in 6 hour intervals and typically are tpically delayed about 8-12 hours before being uploaded to the server. The server only stores the past 10 days of forecasts. 
- ``start_time``: the start time of the simulation
- ``lat_range``: How many 0.25 degree indicies to download cenetered aroudn the ``start_coord``
- ``lon_range``: How many 0.25 degree indicies to download cenetered aroudn the ``start_coord``
- ``download_days``: How many days of data to download from the server, can be a maximum of 10 (limited by the server).  Data from GFS is downloaded in 3 hour increments unlike ERA5 reanlayis forecasts which are in hourly increments. 
- ``start_coord``
